  <h3 id="info" style="color:#302745">This space is meant to get inspired and to inspire others to commit acts of kindness.
    We believe that by giving to others, no matter how big or how small, humans have much more to gain than to lose.
    Feel free to share your personal act of kindness or to share ideas
    of good deeds. And remember, a good deed is never lost.</h3>
